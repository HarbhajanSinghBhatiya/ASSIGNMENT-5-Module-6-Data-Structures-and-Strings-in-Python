1.Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

Problem Statement:
1. Creates a dictionary where student names are the keys and their marks are the values.
2. Asks the user to input a student's name.
3. Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
4. If the student's name is not found, displays an appropriate error message.

How It Works:
1. A dictionary `students_marks` is created with student names as keys and their marks as values.
2. The program prompts the user to input a student's name.
3. If the student's name exists in the dictionary, the program displays the student's marks.
4. If the name is not found, it displays an error message.

Output:

Case 1: Student found
Enter the student's name: Alice 
Alice's marks: 85

Case 2: Student not Found
Enter the student's name: John 
Error: The student 'John' was not found.

2.Demonstrate List Slicing

Problem Statement:
1. The program creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. It extracts the first five elements from the list.
3. It then reverses these extracted elements.
4. Finally, it prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

How It Works:
1. The program starts by creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10 using Python's `range()` function and `list()`.
2. It then extracts the first five elements from the list using list slicing (`numbers[:5]`).
3. The extracted list is reversed using slicing (`[::-1]`).
4. Both the extracted list and the reversed list are printed to the console.

Output:

Original List: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Extracted List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed List: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
